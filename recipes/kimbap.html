    <h2>Description</h2>
    <body>Kimbap is a popular Korean dish made from steamed white rice (bap) and various other ingredients, such as vegetables, meat, and pickled radish, which are rolled in sheets of dried seaweed (kim). The roll is typically sliced into bite-sized pieces and often served with pickled vegetables or dipping sauces. It's similar to sushi but distinct in its ingredients and preparation.</body>

        <li>Prepare the rice by mixing cooked white rice with sesame oil, sesame seeds, and salt, then let it cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Cook and prepare the fillings: julienne and cook the carrot, prepare the egg strips from a thin omelet, julienne the cucumber, and have the pickled radish and other fillings ready.</li>
        <li>Place a sheet of dried seaweed on a bamboo mat, spread a thin layer of rice over it, leaving about 2 inches at the top edge uncovered.</li>
        <li>Arrange the filling ingredients horizontally across the rice about 1 inch from the bottom edge, then use the bamboo mat to roll the seaweed and rice over the fillings, pressing gently to ensure a tight roll.</li>
        <li>Slice the roll into bite-sized pieces using a sharp knife and serve with pickled vegetables or dipping sauces if desired.</li>
